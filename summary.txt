1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose Python because it was a great language for object oriented programming, and it allowed me to import and process the CSV files in a 
quick manner. Specifically the Pandas module allowed me to transform the CSV file into a dataframe and I was able to change the timestamp 
values to a more readable format easily using the "datetime" library. The sys library was used to read the command line arguments.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
The main advantage of my solution is that since I am using a FIFO queue data structure, elements are ordered from oldest payments to newest
payments, meaning that enqueue and dequeue operations take constant time. Other advantages include using the Pandas package, which allows 
the program to quickly import and transform the CSV file without creating too much complexity. The only main disadvantage of this program 
is that if there are n rows in the CSV file, then the FIFO queue will take up O(n) space. However, this is the tradeoff for having constant 
time operations which allows the program to execute quickly.

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
One of my favorite personal projects so far is the Algorithms Visualizer that I am currently working on (called AlgoVis). It is challenging 
because not only you have to worry about implementing algorithms that work, you also have to visualize them. For example, implementing a 
sorting algorithm in the application requires me to focus on animating the exchanges and compares.
